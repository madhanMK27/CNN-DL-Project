**Deep Learning Project**
*  Predicting a person wearing mask or without mask using convolutional neural network

* This repository contains a deep learning project built in a Jupyter Notebook. The project includes downloading data from Kaggle, preprocessing, and applying a deep learning model for a specific task (e.g., classification, image recognition, etc.).

"Features"
* Integration with Kaggle for dataset access.
* Preprocessing of input data.
* Implementation of a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
* Evaluation metrics and performance visualization.
  
"Prerequisites"

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* pip
* Kaggle account with API key
